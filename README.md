## Description

During this course you will learn how to build a real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

## Goals

After finishing this program you can:

- _deal with real-time complexity;_
- _handle real-time client-server interaction;_
- _handle real-time data management;_
- _handle multi-user support._

## Grading

Your efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). You will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test you will be consulted and will be given feedback on things we think deficient and things we think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Improvement |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
|            | _Project_ Your app is working and published on Heroku. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository. Included are a description of the data-lifecycle, real-time events and external data source used by your app.      |             |
|            | _Complexity_ You’ve implemented enough real-time functionality for us to test your comprehension of the subject. A lot of functionality is self-written. You are able to manipulate online examples live.                                                   |             |
|            | _Client-server interaction_ By interacting with the app, a user can influence the data model of the server in real time by directly modifying data OR by influencing API requests between server and source. The student has set up the data manipulations. |             |
|            | _Data management_ The server maintains a data model and each client is continuously updated with the correct data.                                                                                                                                          |             |
|            | _Multi-user support_ Multiple clients can connect to the server. Interaction works as expected and is not dependent on the number of clients. You can explain how your app approaches this.                                                                 |             |

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages 🌐-->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? 📚 -->

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? 🤓 -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features 🤔 -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- This would be a good place for your data life cycle ♻️-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- We all stand on the shoulders of giants, please link all the sources you used in to create this project. -->
